# Lisa the Bug Bot

Lisa is a slack bot who loves squishing bugs. She listens to Jira Server Alerts and keeps a running count of bugs squished by different users.

Based on the [Botkit Slack starter kit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit). Currently deployed at [Cohesity](https://www.cohesity.com).

## Feature Roadmap
 - Randomize the weekly roundup script and the prizes given (in-progress)
 - Accurately handle ties in the weekly-roundup script (in-progress)
 - Track "streaks" for users who win the weekly-roundup multiple weeks in a row, and who place first multiple weeks in a row. Report this information along with the weekly roundup.
